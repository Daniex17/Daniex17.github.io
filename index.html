    <p>This is <em>Anubis</em>. I've had him for about 5 years now (best present <strong>ever</strong>). When he first arrived to the house, he was just a small kitten, no bigger than a shoe. I remember him being such a <strong>curious</strong> little kitten. He'd get in any box he could and crawl into and hide under any small space. I would make barricades so he wouldn't hide but he'd always break out of them. Even though he's grown now, he's as curious and playful as ever. He always tries to sneak attack us by smacking our legs and feet (but he never takes out his claws) and he also likes chasing any object that is being thrown. He's also very smart, he knows how to open and close doors.</p>

    <p>When he's not causing chaos around the house, he likes to keep me company. He enjoys sitting next to me while I study. Another favorite activity of his is sleeping anywhere he can fit (under the bed,chairs, boxes, etc.). Sadly, he's could not come live with me while I'm on campus. But I will be visiting him soon and will be bringing him some of his favorite <a href="https://www.temptationstreats.com/" target="-blank"> treats</a>.</p>
